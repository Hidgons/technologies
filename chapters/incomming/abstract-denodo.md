Data Virtualization is a modern approach of data integration.Denodo is a
data virtualization platform [@denodo] which provides agile, high
performance data integration and data abstraction capabilities.Denodo
platform [@denodo] acts as a logical abstraction between disparate data
sources and consuming applications.Denodo allows [@denodo] intelligent
caching for real-time performance.By becoming single virtual layer
Denodo Platform [@denodo] reduces redundancy and resolved quality issues
by imposing data model governance.Denodo platform can be used for many
use cases covering operational and analytics functions.
