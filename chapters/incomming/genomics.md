With the size of medical data getting increased exponentially from 
petabytes to exabytes rapidly, Google came up with Google Genomics 
as extension to Google cloud platform.It helps the life science 
community organize the information about genomics and also make it 
available. Researchers are able to apply Google powerful technologies 
such as Google Search and Maps to securely store, process, explore, 
and share large, complex genomics datasets.Multiple genome repositories 
data can be processed using Google Genomics within seconds as it is 
backed by Google bigtable and Spanner 
technologies [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics]. 

This is based on open standard from Global Alliance of Genomics and 
health; These open standards help in achieving high level of 
interoperability for data of genomics type.It is fully integrated with 
Google cloud virtual machine, storage and SQL/NoSQL databases.
It helps analysing Genomic data in real-time with BigQuery. Pragrammers 
can analyze worldwide genomics data using their prefered language with 
Cloud Datalab in transaction mode or in batch mode using GATK-Genome
Analysis Toolkit on Google Genomics. For faster processing and analyzing 
such large data sets Apache spark or grid cluster may be 
used [@hid-sp18-523-www-genomics].
