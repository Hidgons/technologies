GitHub is a software management platform that offers free and fee-based
services that can be used for managing source code for software
projects. However, GitHub also offers an API through its Developer site.
The API can be used to analyze a large body of data that is stored at
GitHub. The data can be used to provide insight into trending software
technologies, data sources that pertain to non-software management
domains. For example, the GitHub resource
OpenRefine [@hid-sp18-505-OpenRefine2018] is a reference to a variety of
data sources that are open for public use [@hid-sp18-505-GitHub2018].
