H20 is a open source platform that can execute highly advanced and complex
machine learning algorithms in faster and scalable way,regardless of the 
size, format and location of the data. It achieves this by serializing the 
data faster between nodes and clusters that stores huge amount of data. 
Data processing is done in memory thus providing faster 
response [@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o].

It uses fine grain parallelism technique for processing of distributed data 
archiving 100 times faster speed as compared to traditional mapreduce, 
without compromising on accuracy. Most popular H2O products are 
H2O4GPU, This product enables the usage of high performance GPUs in 
running complex machine learning algorithm with lightening speed. Sparking 
Water, This product enables the usage of Spark transformation and mapping 
of data while running complex machine learning algorithm and 
Driverless AI, An automated machine learning platform to create artificial 
intelligence products and services[@hid-sp18-523-www-h2o]. 

Many companies across different domain such as banks, insurance, online sales 
are using H2O platform for their machine learning and AI related research. 
H2O also has GUI web based workflow to define machine learning steps such as 
data loading, data preparation, data cleaning , model generation and model 
evaluation. H20 platform also offers developers to customize and write code 
in their preferred proramming languages such as python , scala, Java, R etc 
to create , validate, test and deploy mahcine learning predictive models
