OpenNN is a collection of function developed for research work in field of 
Deep learning and deployment of neural network. OpenNN is an open 
source library. As the development of OpenNN library is in C++ programming 
language, which give it a benefit of low memory usage and provides high 
performance with less computation time. 
With multi processing, shared memory and GPU accelerations, program can have 
CPU parallelism and result in better and faster computation. 
OpenNN provides algorthims for data mining as libraries and functions, which 
are utilized with data mining and predictive modeling[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN]. 

OpenNN libraries and functions are integrated with analytical tool, such as  
Neural Designer[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN] which provides a UI interface for users.
This provide the ease of visualization for the users, to do any data entry 
tasks or once the model is created and output is generated, can provide 
results interpretation[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN].

With OpenNN, the neural network is establishes multilayer perceptron, which 
describes the count of neurons and their respective connectivity. OpenNN 
model can be enhanced with scaling or unscaling, where the layer can exists 
with basic statistics of mean, standard deviations, minimum or maximum 
values of the input or output variables[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn].
