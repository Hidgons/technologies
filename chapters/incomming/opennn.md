OpenNN is a collection of open source library functions developed for deep learning and the 
deployment of neural networks. The library is developed in C++ providing low memory usage and  high 
performance with reduced computation time. 

gvl, Unclear: For better computation, CPU 
parallelism can be configured. 

This (gvl what is this?, unclear) is utilized in the field of predictive 
modeling and data mining and can be embedded as an API with analytical tool. 
Neural Designer (unclear how does neural designer fit in here, refernce missing) is a analytical tool which has OpenNN library and provides 
UI interface for users. This provide the ease for the users to do any data 
entry tasks or once the model is created and output is generated, can provide 
results interpretation[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNN].

gvl, grammar error: There is multilayer perceptron concept is built with implementation of neural 
network in OpenNN, this can support and contain layers which are for scaling, 
unscaling, bounding, probabilistic and conditions layers
[@hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn].

gvl: try to write 300 words about it.
