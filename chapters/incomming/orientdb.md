OrientDB is NoSQL database, which supports the graph engines and it can be 
implemented as document database or as a Object-Oriented database 
[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDB]. With Document database, it stores the documents 
as Key and value pairs. It refers group of these documents as collections. 
In OrientDB, classes or clusters are same as Tables and every documents are 
same as rows in relational models. With Graph databases, it creates the 
nodes known as Vertex and arcs known as Edges for storing the data. Vertex 
are same as rows in relational database. Vertex and Edges properties are 
same as the columns in relational database. It supports SQL as the built in 
query language. It is adhering to the ACID properties for database management 
systems. OrientDB offers indexing feature for high performance with 3 
different type of algorithms [@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBconcepts].
Graph databases are useful for developing application related to social 
networking and establish relationships between objects with respect to there 
properties. It maintains class relation using documents and links in document 
model [@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBgraph].
