OrientDB is NoSQL database, which supports the graph engines and it can be 
implemented as document database or as an Object-Oriented database 
[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDB]. With Document database, it stores the documents 
as Key and value pairs. It refers group of these documents as collections. 
In OrientDB, classes or clusters are similar to Tables and every documents are 
similar to rows when compared with relational models. With Graph databases, 
it creates the nodes known as Vertex and arcs known as Edges for storing the 
data. Vertex are same as rows in relational database. Vertex and Edges 
properties are similar to the columns in relational database. It supports 
SQL as the built in query language. SB Tree [@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBgraphI]
is the default indexing mechanism implemented with OrientDB for optimizing  
inserting of data and range queries.

It is adhering to the ACID properties for database management systems. 
OrientDB offers indexing feature for high performance with 3 different type 
of algorithms[@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBconcepts].

Graph databases are useful for developing application related to social 
networking and establish relationships between objects with respect to there 
properties. It maintains class relation using documents and links in document 
model [@hid-sp18-520-OrientDBgraph].
