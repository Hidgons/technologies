PyTorch is known as Python based scientific computation package, built to 
support deep learning researches and neural network models. PyTorch has 
many packages and are used for deep learning, multi processing, loading 
data. It is fast and has high computation speed when run with any size of 
datasets [@hid-sp18-520-PyTorch]. PyTorch uses Tensors for building 
computation and are very similar to Numpy arrays.It uses the GPUs for its 
computation and responsible for faster retrieval of the data or results 
which are required for neural network. There are many variable provided 
by PyTorch which detail on Tensor and its gradient. It provides provision 
for computational graphs which helps alot during the debugging of the code 
or viewing any results from any computations step by step 
[@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchgrad].
There are many modules defined with PyTorch, some of them are like nn 
Module, which is acting as neural network layers producing outputs with 
weights details. Autograd module, which captures and helps calculating 
derivatives and gradients. With Optim module, which are very helpful when 
implementing the optimized model for neural network models creation 
[@hid-sp18-520-PyTorchtensor].
