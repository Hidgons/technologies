Google vision API helps users quickly classify images into thousands
of predefined meaningful categories. Usage of API has made the 
herculean task of correct labeling/classification of images simple. 
Digital data such as images, voice, video are stored and transmitted 
over network at much faster rate with increase of social media usage. 
Google Vision API  provides a platform that helps researchers and 
developers identify and categorize meaningful insights hidden in such 
formats. 

It does this by encapsulating powerful machine learning 
models (KNN, Regression) etc for classification of images. 
It help detects objects and faces within images. Finds and reads 
printed words contained within images through 
Optical Character Recognition i,e OCR[@hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision]. 

Developers can build meta data on their image catalog, they can tag 
rating of the content and define the category such as adult content, 
offensive content etc using the API. Marketing campaign may be launched 
through image sentiment analysis. It can be accessed 
through REST API. Document classification and product search are other
 popular use cases of Cloud Vision other than image search. Label detection, 
Web detection, Logo detection, Handwriting recognition, Landmark detection, 
Face detection, content moderation are most pupular features of Cloud Vision 
API [@hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision].
