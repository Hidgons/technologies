Google vision API helps users quickly classify images into thousands
of predefined meaningful categories. Image classification is complex
and technically challenging task. It has been made simple by the use
of Vision API. Digital data such as images, voice, and video are 
stored and transmitted over network at much faster rate than ever 
before. Google Vision API  provides a platform that helps researchers 
and developers identify and categorize meaningful insights hidden in 
such formats with high performance and greater accuracy. 

It does this by encapsulating powerful machine learning 
models (KNN, Regression) etc for classification of images. 
It help detects objects and faces within images. Finds and reads 
printed words contained within images through 
Optical Character Recognition i,e OCR[@hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision]. 

Developers can build meta data on their image catalog, they can tag 
rating of the content and define the category such as adult content, 
offensive content etc using the API. Marketing campaign may be launched 
through image sentiment analysis. It can be accessed 
through REST API. Document classification and product search are other
 popular use cases of Cloud Vision other than image search. Label detection, 
Web detection, Logo detection, Handwriting recognition, Landmark detection, 
Face detection, content moderation are most pupular features of Cloud Vision 
API [@hid-sp18-523-www-google-vision].
