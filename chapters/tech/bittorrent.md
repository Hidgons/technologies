BitTorrent refers to that method of data transfer which allows large
data files to be broken down into smaller ones for efficient data
sharing [@fa18-523-73-Cohen2002]. The smaller files with the data can be
downloaded from several sources simultaneously. It is indeed the most
common protocol that enables peer to peer file sharing with ease and
most efficiently.

This technology works by allowing users to create a small file,
referred to as torrent, which contains information about the files
and the computers that manage the distribution of those files. To
download a file, one needs to find and open the torrent created and
start downloading files piece by piece. The peers can also share the
pieces with any other interested party trying to download the same
files. This sharing enhances easy file downloads as more pieces of
data can be found in multiple sources. BitTorrent provides faster
download speeds at a significantly low bandwidth as a result of
breaking down files into smaller pieces.

When downloading files from multiple
sources, the computers and the network are at risk of getting infected
with viruses, malware, and spyware programs. Another major security
concern is the directive on the torrent website to leave the computer
running so that files can be shared with other peers. This renders the
computer prone to numerous types of cyber-attacks, regardless of
whether or not one has anti-virus protection on one's computer.
Additionally, people feel uncomfortable with BitTorrent because it does not
offer anonymity to their IP address, which means anybody can view other's IP
address while the person downloading files using the BitTorrent platform.
