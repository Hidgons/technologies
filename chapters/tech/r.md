R, a GNU project, is a successor to S, a statistical programming
language. It offers a range of capabilities including

> ``programming language, high level graphics, interfaces to other
> languages and debugging.  R is an integrated suite of software
> facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical
> display''.

The statistical and graphical techniques provided by R make it popular
in the statistical community. The statistical techniques provided
include linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
time-series analysis, classification and clustering to name a few
[@www-R]. The number of packages available in R has made it popular
for use in machine learning, visualization, and data operations tasks
like data extraction, cleaning, loading, transformation, analysis,
modeling and visualization. It's strength lies in analyzing data using
its rich library but falls short when working with very large datasets
[@book-R].
    
#### R Summary (Ritu Sanjay fa18-523-66) :

>"R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)]

The many advantages of R include its package ecosystem. Developers agree that if a statistical technique exists then there is a good 
chance that a package for this function already exists. Being open-source, r allows new packages to be written and shared among 
programmers.
