messages from producers and pushing them to queues based on the rules
and policies that the exchange type outlines. Such message queuing :o:

forced to undertake resource heavy procedures abruptly :o:.


It is lightweight and
relatively easy to deploy on buildings :o: as well as in the cloud. It
supports diverse messaging protocols :o:. This technology is deployable in
federated as well as distributed configurations to achieve
high-availability and high-scale requests. Furthermore, it can run on the :o: 
modern could environment, is compatible with most operating systems,
