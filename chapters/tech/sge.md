Sun Grid Engine(SGE), currently known as Oracle Grid Engine (OGE) was an open-source grid computing computer cluster and later bought by Oracle and then bought by Univa Corporation in 2013 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine]. SGE is the open-source version whereas OGE is the version that is owned and supported by Univa. Similar to Slurm, SGE is responsible for scheduling and managing jobs and is used in high-performance computing clusters. 

SGE schedules jobs by allowing job submition, push them to queue and execute them with resource allocation functionality. SGE utilizes load balancer to distribute jobs and prevent resouce overload from any specific nodes. SGE also allows the ability to monitor jobs to check jobs statuses [http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/intro2UnixandSGE/sun_grid_engine_for_beginners/README.html]



Before 2012, OGE was used on the cloud for a while and was able to handle thousands of nodes. In 2012, it was tested for scalability on 10,000 nodes of Amazon EC2 clusters in 2012. As a results, there are still work to be done to optimize the run on 10,000 nodes and it is believed that OGE can handle all the way up to 20,000 in the future [http://blogs.scalablelogic.com/2012/11/running-10000-node-grid-engine-cluster.html].
