TensorFlow is a software library that utilize dataflow that is most commonly used for training model especially in Deep Learning and neural networks which evolves around mathematical computation. Computation is done through the dataflow structure where Tensors, the data itself, are being passed to nodes, which perform mathematical computation, and each nodes are connected by edges, indicate the flow of the Tensors [@fa18-423-02-youtube-edureka-tensorflow].

Computation in Tensorflow is being mapped into different cluster of machines which are not limited to only desktop machines and server, but also different CPUs and GPUs of mobile devices [@fa18-423-02-tensorflow2015-whitepaper]. As such, Tensorflow APIs are available in multiple programming language such as Python, Javascript, C++, Java, Go, and Swift.

Tensorflow, with a strong training model framework, has been utilized in variery of use case by developers coming from multiple field of interest. For instance, the use of neural networks for search ranking in search engines and image recognition in health industry that detects pattern in symptons and likelyhood of the disease [@fa18-423-02-tensorflow-use] [@fa18-423-02-tensorflow-youtube].
